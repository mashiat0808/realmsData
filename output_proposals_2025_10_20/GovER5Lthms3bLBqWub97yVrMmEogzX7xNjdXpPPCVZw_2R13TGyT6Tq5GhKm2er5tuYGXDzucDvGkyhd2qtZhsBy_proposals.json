As in an earlier proposal mentioned we would do a “free” swap. Yet if we keep it “free”there are no funds to work with after the swap and reveal is done. To make the swap FLWR based you will get pressure on the SPL and secure funds so the project has some leeway to operate in the short term. We propose to do the FLWR swap in 2 steps. One will be at the moment that you will get the new unrevealed token. The second will be at the moment of reveal.\n\nFull proposal can be found here: https://publuu.com/flip-book/211729/508410/page/1","name":"FLWR Swap ","voteType":{"type":0},"options":[{"label":"Approve","voteWeight":"8f0d1800","voteResult":1,"instructionsExecutedCount":0,"instructionsCount":0,"instructionsNextIndex":0}],"denyVoteWeight":"00","reserved1":0,"draftAt":"64d7642b","signingOffAt":"64d7642d","votingAt":"64d7642d","votingAtSlot":"0c931ef7","votingCompletedAt":1692269485,"executionFlags":0,"maxVoteWeight":"0147d35700","voteThreshold":{"type":0,"value":40},"vetoVoteWeight":"00"},"owner":"GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw"},{"pubkey":"Fcy31AAykgrAcLuuFe2CuFfKtfNW3aR8y9hTUmSsXnSn","account":{"accountType":14,"governance":"5UySP9vhJqMj7Rs5zDF5DJgAs79QhfqfdkBD7kBxPnCx","governingTokenMint":"GPmccipxcdbTevzJz57jH5Wg8TXceV2f4XjqY4og1LH9","state":3,"tokenOwnerRecord":"7iDdk62VqfrRiM14XzUHENdvcDBe4TproWthDkN2ej7h","signatoriesCount":1,"signatoriesSignedOffCount":1,"descriptionLink":"Overview: This proposal is intended to help Sol Flowers move forward without the risk of legal issues inthe future by removing the former team and their art.
